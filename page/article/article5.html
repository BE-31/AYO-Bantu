      <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Why is kids' mental health important?</span></p>
      <p>
        Having good mental health is key to the healthy development and wellbeing of every child. Kids need good mental health - not only to be able to deal with challenges and adapt to change, but so they can feel good about themselves,
        build healthy relationships with others and enjoy life.
      </p>
      <p>
        A kid’s mental health can be influenced by many things, like family circumstances, school life and life events. While children can experience mental health issues at any age, they are most at risk between the ages of 12 and 16
        years.
      </p>
      <p>If your child, or a child you know, is having mental health issues, the best thing you can do is get them some help, before it gets worse - see 'Where to get help' below.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Mental health issues in children</span></p>
      <p>
        Everyone feels sad, angry or upset sometimes, including children. But if a kid feels like this most of the time, it’s a sign they may need help. Other signs include difficulty coping, getting on with others or staying interested in
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>About 1 in 7 children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 have recently experienced a mental health disorder in Australia. The most common disorder is ADHD, followed by anxiety, depression and conduct disorder.</p>
      <p>The number of contacts to Kids Helpline increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of these contacts were about mental health and emotional well-being.</p>
      <p>If you think your child has a mental health issue, it’s important to reach out for professional help.</p>
