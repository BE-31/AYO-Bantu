        <p>The eyes are more than windows to the soul. With advances in eye health technology, they can also give a unique look into your health.</p>
        <p>“The eye is a real window into what’s happening in your body,” says NIH eye health expert Dr. Houmam Araj. It’s a convenient way for a doctor to get a clear view of your blood vessels, nerves, and connecting tissue without surgery.</p>
        <p>Researchers are working on new technologies to help doctors get a better look into the eye and catch diseases earlier. They’re also designing new tools to help people with vision loss get around in their daily lives.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:700 ;">What Doctors See Now</span></p>
        <p>Getting regular eye exams is important, even if you think your vision is fine. Eye exams allow an eye care professional to monitor your eyes for common vision problems and signs of disease.</p>
        <p>“There aren’t early warning signs for the most common eye diseases,” says NIH eye specialist Dr. Rachel Bishop. “By identifying diseases early, you have the best treatment options and the best chance of preserving good vision.”</p>
        <p>A comprehensive exam will often include eye dilation. After checking your vision sharpness, the doctor places drops in your eyes to dilate (widen) the dark center of your eyes, called the pupil. This allows more light into your eyes, just like opening a door lets light into a dark room. Then the doctor can examine the inside of the eye.</p>
        <p>A special magnifying lens is needed to examine the tissues at the back of the eye. These tissues include the retina (light-sensitive tissue), the macula (central part of the retina for sharp vision), and the optic nerve (carries visual messages from the eye to the brain). Damage to these areas may be a sign of an eye disease.</p>
        <p>“The eyes can also reflect illness that begins in another tissue far from the eyes themselves,” Araj explains. Eye exams may reveal health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune disorders, sexually transmitted diseases, and cancers.</p>
        <p>For example, eye doctors often detect diabetes by observing damage to the retina and blood vessels in the eye. The disease may show up in eye tissue before a blood glucose (sugar) test reveals it. Early detection can prevent not only vision loss but other serious complications.</p>
