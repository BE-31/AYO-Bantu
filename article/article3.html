    <div class="article-news">
        <p>The Social Security and Supplemental Security Income disability programs are the largest of several Federal programs that provide assistance to people with disabilities. While these two programs are different in many ways, both are administered by the Social Security Administration and only individuals who have a disability and meet medical criteria may qualify for benefits under either program.</p>
        <p>Social Security Disability Insurance pays benefits to you and certain members of your family if you are "insured," meaning that you worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes.</p>
        <p>Supplemental Security Income pays benefits based on financial need.</p>
        <p>When you apply for either program, we will collect medical and other information from you and make a decision about whether or not you meet Social Security's definition of disability. Periodically, we will need updated information about your condition.  You may receive a Disability Update Report (SSA-455).  This form can now be completed online.</p>
        <p>Use the Benefits Eligibility Screening Tool to find out which programs may be able to pay you benefits.</p>
        <p>If your application has recently been denied, the Internet Appeal is a starting point to request a review of our decision about your eligibility for disability benefits.</p>
