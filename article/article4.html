    </div>

    <div class="article-news">
        <p>Since the Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted in 1990, many social barriers have been removed or reduced for people with disabilities. But there is more work that needs to be done for people with disabilities to become more independent and involved in their world. Good health is important to be able to work, learn, and be engaged within a community.</p>
        <p>This web page provides information for people with disabilities about healthy living, safety, school, transitions, independent living, and finding support.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:700 ;">Healthy Living</span></p>
        <p>People with disabilities need health care and health programs for the same reasons anyone else does—to stay well, active, and a part of the community.</p>
        <p>Having a disability does not mean a person is not healthy or that he or she cannot be healthy. Being healthy means the same thing for all of us—getting and staying well so we can lead full, active lives. That means having the tools and information to make healthy choices and knowing how to prevent illness.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:700 ;">Safety</span></p>
        <p>If your application has recently been denied, the Internet Appeal is a starting point to request a review of our decision about your eligibility for disability benefits.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:700 ;">Assistive Technology</span></p>
        <p>Assistive technologies (AT) are devices or equipment that can be used to help a person with a disability fully engage in life activities. AT’s can help enhance functional independence and make daily living tasks easier through the use of aids that help a person travel, communicate with others, learn, work, and participate in social and recreational activities. An example of an assistive technology can be anything from a low-tech device, such as a magnifying glass, to a high tech device, such as a special computer that talks and helps someone communicate. Other examples are wheelchairs, walkers, and scooters, which are mobility aids that can be used by persons with physical disabilities.</p>
